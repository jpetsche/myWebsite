		<p>I am a Junior Computer Science student at Iowa State University who is constantly pursuing the advancement of my education. I plan to eventually pursue an executive MBA after obtaining valuable experience in the workplace for the purpose of furthering my career into exciting new directions. I am an extremely motivated and determined individual and I am always willing to put in the extra work. I believe the workplace is a place for perfection, excellence, and efficiency. Whatever the challenge is, I won't quit until I am satisfied with my solution. Adversity only strengthens my motivation and desire to succeed as I am extremely determined to make a name for myself in the years to come.</p>

			<h3>Eras: A JavaScript Web-Based Game</h3>
			<h5>Started August 2016</h5>
			<p>Developing a top-down, real-time 2D web-based multiplayer game. Currently in production. We are using HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Javascript, JSCanvas, Nodejs, Websockets, MySQL, and many other built in JavaScript libraries. This project uses Nodejs and websockets to maintain a real-time connectivity between all clients and the server. The client takes user input from the keyboard and draws all of the gameplay with JSCanvas. Eras also uses an account and chat system that is implemented with MySQL, PHP by means of AJAX, and a Database.
